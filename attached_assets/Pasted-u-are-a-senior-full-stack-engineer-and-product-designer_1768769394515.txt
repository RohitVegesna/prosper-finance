u are a senior full-stack engineer and product designer.
Build a modern, secure, multi-tenant personal finance web application using Replit as the dev environment and Neon (PostgreSQL) as the database.
Core Vision
This is a personal finance & legacy information system that a user can maintain during their life and eventually pass on to dependents. The app must support multiple customers (tenants) separated by domain or subdomain, so friends can use the same platform independently.

Tech Stack (Required)
* Frontend: React + TypeScript
* Styling: Tailwind CSS
* UI components: modern card-based layout, grid views, subtle animations
* Backend: Node.js (Express or similar)
* Database: Neon PostgreSQL
* Auth: Secure login system
* File storage: store uploaded policy documents (PDFs, images) and allow download
* ORM: Prisma or similar (recommended)

Authentication & Roles
* Master Admin Account
    * Can create tenants (customers)
    * Can assign domains or subdomains
    * Can invite users
    * Can control access permissions
* Tenant Users
    * Only see their own data
    * Login tied to domain or tenant ID
    * Future-ready for dependents / read-only access

Multi-Tenancy Requirements
* Each domain/subdomain = one tenant
* Database schema must support tenant isolation:
    * tenant_id on all major tables
* Auth must resolve tenant from domain
* One Neon database, logically separated per tenant
